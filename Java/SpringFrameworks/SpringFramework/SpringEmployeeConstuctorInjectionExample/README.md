# README.md for SpringEmployeeConstructorInjectionExample

This project demonstrates the use of constructor-based dependency injection in Spring Framework. It showcases how to configure beans using XML and how to utilize constructor injection to manage dependencies.

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java/com/example/constructor/**: Contains the Java classes for the project.
  - **Employee.java**: Defines the `Employee` class with properties and methods for employee details.
  - **Department.java**: Defines the `Department` class for department details.

- **src/main/resources/**: Contains the XML configuration file.
  - **constructorInjectionConfig.xml**: This XML file contains the configuration for constructor injection, defining the `Employee` and `Department` beans.

- **src/test/java/com/example/constructor/**: Contains the unit tests for the project.
  - **EmployeeTest.java**: This file contains unit tests for the `Employee` class to ensure its functionality.

- **pom.xml**: The Maven configuration file that specifies dependencies and build settings for the project.

## How to Run
