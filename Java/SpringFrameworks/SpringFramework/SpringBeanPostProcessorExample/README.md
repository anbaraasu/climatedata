# Spring Bean Post Processor Example

This project demonstrates the use of the Spring Framework's `BeanPostProcessor` interface to modify bean instances during their initialization phase. The example includes a simple bean and a custom post-processor that alters the bean's properties.

## Components

- **SimpleBean**: A simple Java class that represents a bean with properties that can be modified.
- **CustomBeanPostProcessor**: A class that implements the `BeanPostProcessor` interface to modify the `SimpleBean` instance after its initialization.
- **postProcessorConfig.xml**: The Spring configuration file that defines the beans and the post-processor.
- **BeanPostProcessorTest**: Unit tests to verify the functionality of the `CustomBeanPostProcessor`.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SpringBeanPostProcessorExample
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   Use Maven to build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application using a main method in a separate class or through a test case that loads the Spring context.

## Usage

- The `CustomBeanPostProcessor` will automatically be applied to any beans defined in the `postProcessorConfig.xml` file. 
- Modify the properties of `SimpleBean` as needed to see how the post-processor affects the bean.

## Testing

Run the tests using Maven:
```bash
mvn test
```

This will execute the unit tests defined in `BeanPostProcessorTest.java` to ensure that the post-processor behaves as expected.

## Conclusion

This example illustrates how to use Spring's `BeanPostProcessor` to customize bean initialization. You can extend this example by adding more complex logic in the post-processor or by creating additional beans.
